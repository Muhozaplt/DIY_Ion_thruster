# DIY Ion thruster
> By Pilote Muhoza

In this project, I will create and document a DIY ion thruster. 
An ion thruster, ion drive, or ion engine is a form of electric propulsion used for spacecraft propulsion. An ion thruster creates a cloud of positive ions from a neutral gas by ionizing it to extract some electrons from its atoms. The ions are then accelerated using electricity to create thrust. 

For more information, I will be using this study [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1538) for theory 

Materials:

1. Transformer
2. DC power supply
3. Electrodes
4. conductive wires
